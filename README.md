Each line corresponds to one graph. Different columns describe different features and aspects of algorithm performance: 
* Column A: name of the graph;
* Column B: dataset that the graph belongs to;
* Columns C-AF: describe algorithm performance. Column name always contains three words:
  * first word: 'Width' or 'Time' indicates which aspect of algorithm performance is described;
  * second word: indicates whether it was an exact algorithm, or - in the case of a heuristic algorithm - how much runtime it was allowed;
  * third word: indicates which algorithm's performance is described;
* Column AG: number of vertices in the graph
* Column AH: number of edges
* Columns AI and AJ: ratios of vertices to edges and vice versa
* Column AK: edge density
* Columns AL-AS: characteristics of the degree distribution (first quartile, median, third quartile, minimum, mean, maximum, variation coefficient, entropy)
